            A strategy game can be turn-based or in real-time, and decision-making is based on your command of the resources you're given.

                <p>Sid Meier's Civilization series and its spinoffs are a beloved addition to the strategy genre. Its technical label is called '4X,' which refers to its four primary goals: eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate. Each game covers a very long period of time, not unlike Risk or Settlers of Catan, giving the player control of an entire civilization or species from its ancient origins to the nuclear age or the space age. Civilization is a turn-based strategy game, but the game creator can adjust the rules to allow for timed turns to emulate the duress of an RTS. The 'dungeon master' or creator of the game can choose whether to make it a team-based affair or a free-for-all, but having conflicting goals with your allies can be just as much a hindrance on your victory as your enemies do.</p>

                <p>Age of Empires is a series of historically-based real-time strategy games, pitting players in the roles of different warring nations based on their ability to fight and the utilization of the resources they're able to acquire. The story mode of the first game covers events between the Stone Age and the Classical period of Europe and Asia, with its expansion covering the Roman Empire. The Age of Kings follow Europe and Asia through the Middle Ages, and its expansion covers scenarios over the Spanish conquest of Mexico, El Cid, and Attila the Hun. The third game and its expansion take place during the European colonization of the Americas, and its second expansion follows the rise of Asia in the same period. Age of Empires Online focuses on the Greek and Egyptian civilizations, and the Age of Mythology spinoff (with its expansion) focus on the Bronze Age, but focus on mythology as their themes rather than an accurate historical documentation. Given the previous recitation it certainly caters to the history buffs, but the multiplayer/competitive aspect is one of the very first and very best entries in the real-time strategy world of video games. Although the multiplayer scene is not as hot as it used to be back in the day, the gameplay itself is an absolute classic and is a must-get for anyone that even thinks they're keen on real-time strategy. </p>

                <p>The StarCraft games are truly a trend-setter in terms of strategy games, but also in the world of competitive e-sports. The original game gathered a solid following around the world; while the rest of the world has seemingly forgotten about it, the current playerbase is heavily concentrated in South Korea, where pro players and teams compete for sponsors, money matches, and the chance to debut on live broadcasts across TV and the Internet alike. Players choose from three different species to play as, each of which have their own types of buildings, units, and abilities, and race against the clock to develop the most efficient method of attack in real time. You focus on obtaining resources to fund more units, strategically build bases, and fund research more of your species' technology to improve said units and bases.</p>

                <p>X-COM (or XCOM) is a unique science-fiction game in which an international military-based organization is tasked with countering alien invasions of Earth. While not growing immensely popular with its first entries, it gained a cult following and has influenced a number of clones, mods, spiritual successors, and even unofficial remakes. The series was officially rebooted under publisher 2K Games, beginning with XCOM: Enemy Unknown, developed by Civilization's Firaxis Games, and released in 2012 to the critical and commercial success it truly deserved. It was followed by the prequel The Bureau: XCOM Declassified, an odd deviation by means of a third-person shooter, and XCOM 2, an iteration more faithful to Enemy Unknown's style and gameplay with more bells and whistles attached. The development team under 2K has done an incredible job of listening to their core fanbase and learning from modders, further perfecting the model they've created with more deft precision than they've ever reached before. The only real issue players take with the game is an internal battle with the RNG (random number generator), having the player fight their urges to reload their save and "save" themselves from losing their precious operators. Devs even included an "Ironman" difficulty, removing the player's ability to achieve the former and go through the game bearing any and all scars. If you're looking for a great strategy game, look no further!</p>

                    INTO THE BREACH <br><br>
                    Publishers: Subset Games <br><br>

                <p>Into the Breach is a unique strategy game that I believe everyone should try. It takes elements from a lot of sources; it's not quite a full-on roguelike, but it takes certain elements like RNG and combines them into a turn-based strategy game in which you have perfect data. Data specifically on where and how far your enemies will attack, how much damage they do, and how many are coming, and you're shown just how limited your resources are and how many mistakes you can really make under the pressure to reach the end. Set in the far future, humanity is fighting against an army of bug monsters called the Vek. The player controls a team of time-travelling warriors in various types of mechs, given various abilities to damage, displace, or disable each enemy to your and your city's benefit. The "life bar" is your city's capacity for electricity on the power grid, and you find or buy random items to apply to your characters or mechs. This game came from the creators of FTL, and its origins can be plainly seen, but both games are immensely fun and satisfying in their own ways.</p>

                    FTL: FASTER THAN LIGHT <br><br>

                    Developers: Subset Games <br><br>

                </p>

                <p>FTL is a space-based, top-down real-time strategy roguelike where you control the crew of a single spacecraft, holding critical information to be delivered to an allied fleet while being pursued by a large rebel fleet. You must guide your crew through your choice of sectors, each with their own planets and procedurally-generated events to help or aid you at random. Combat takes place in pausable real time, and if your ship is destroyed you must start again from square one. Based on tabletop board games and non-strategic space combat video games, you're forced to manage the various functions of your space ship in mid-combat, such as your oxygen, erupting fires, or even fighting with hostile aliens boarding your ship. It was one of the most well-known of Kickstarter's major successes, releasing to positive reviews and also saw an Advanced Edition that added several different ships, events, and other gameplay elements for free for anyone that purchased the game. It is an astounding but difficult game, but I implore you to give it a try! </p>
