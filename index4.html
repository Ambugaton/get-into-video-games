            The origins of our common role-playing games (RPGs) stem from the basis of 'Dungeons and Dragons,' which assigns the player a specific class and a set of skills to advance through a pre-written or original story design.

                    THE BINDING OF ISAAC <br><br>
                    Publishers: Florian Himsl, Edmund McMillen <br><br>

                </p>

                <p>The Binding of Isaac is what's called a "roguelike," a 2-D dungeon crawler that heavily utilizes a Random Number Generator to change problems and solutions you find in each instance of the game. While it does stray far from the typical framework of a role-playing game, it keeps to its stat-based roots and utilizes RNG to heighten or lighten its difficulty. It will consistently change what enemies populate a room, where they populate and how many, what items will drop from said enemies on death, what passive or active items you find, and even what bosses you'll encounter before you reach the usually-static final boss. The game is built towards multiple runs of trial and error: slowly refining your playstyle, developing better tactics against enemies/bosses, and learning proper damage control if the RNG happens to do you any wrong.</p>

                    DIABLO <br><br>
                    Publishers: Blizzard Entertainment, Sierra Entertainment <br><br>

                </p>

                <p>Diablo is considered one of the classic RPGs of the gaming world today. Playing as one of many different classes, you're guided through a dungeon-crawler with and on-rails storyline in which you must defeat enemies without being defeated. Each of the three games are set in the same general geographic area of Tristram, attempting to liberate the village and its surrounding citizens from the invasion of Diablo and the Prime Evils, his demonic followers. The point-and-click mechanic feels a bit overused and possibly even underperforming when compared to other games in the same genre, but it was one of the first of its kind to popularize this type of action-based hack-and-slash game. Each character has its own nuances, between damage-dealing, magic-using, or hard defense, so it takes a lot of knowledge to play solo or when playing with a group, as difficulty scales with the amount of players in a party. I loved the series when it came out, but other games have very much overshadowed its presence over the last several years.</p>

                <p>Divinity: Original Sin II is considered one of the best role-playing games of all time. Built like a typical Dungeons and Dragons-style game, you can take a full team or even solo-run the entire way through several chapters and with any type of playstyle you so choose. You can choose from any of five premade characters with their own unique, pre-written storylines, or even create your own character in typical D'n'D fashion, and reach multiple different endings based on your decisions along the way or which characters you decide to kill on the way to the end. It even has room for local and online multiplayer modes, both cooperative and competitive, giving the game its own flavor of replayability and freshness when mixed with all its other elements. I implore you to give this one a go, even if RPGs are not your forte! Even though it's deep within the confines of the genre, it's such a unique experience that skipping this entry would be nigh criminal.</p>

                </p>

                <p>The Monster Hunter series has taken a long time to build itself up as a big name title, but that hasn't stopped its newest entry Monster Hunter World from selling over 15 million copies since the time of this posting. Capcom digs deep into their fighting game roots and combines the character-action style combat (similar to Devil May Cry) with an item collection system and crafting system to incentivize your grind through increasingly difficult monsters that have a vague basis on dinosaurs in design. Each monster has a varied moveset to learn and fight around, and each instance becomes tougher as you advance. It becomes difficult to classify the series as simply one genre, as it encompasses role-playing elements in a multiplayer setting, utilizes adventure elements with its material-gathering and crafting system, and its combat system changes drastically with each type of weapon you can equip.</p>

                    FINAL FANTASY <br><br>
                    Publishers: Square, Square Enix, Nintendo <br><br>
                    Developers: Square, Square Enix <br><br>
                    Release date: 1987 || 1988 || 1990 || 1991 || 1992 || 1994 || 1997 || 1999 || 2000 || 2001 || 2002 || 2006 || 2009 || 2010 || 2016 || 2020 <br>
                </p>

                <p>Final Fantasy is one the longest-standing series around, and has truly stood the test of time since its inception. Originally called such due to the director's thinking it would be the last game he ever developed, it ended up spawning over 15 individual entries and multiple spinoffs since its original release in 1987. Each entry is typically a standalone story, each with its own setting, plot, and main characters, but plays to the fancies of former fans by bringing certain characters back as references or even re-usable characters for nostalgia's sake. The gameplay mechanics typically entail a team-oriented and/or turn-based fighting style, but have recently adopted a real-time combat system in later entries. It's given way to plenty of imitators and homages, plenty of which are made from the popular game-making software RPG-Maker, which emulates the feel of the very first few entries in the Final Fantasy franchise. Going back to play the older entries is something I'd recommend once you can decide if you like this type of game or not, but the true beauty comes from the ability to start from any entry you like!</p>

                    FALLOUT: NEW VEGAS <br><br>
                    Publishers: Bethesda Softworks <br><br>
                    Developers: Obsidian Entertainment <br><br>
                    Release date: October 2010 <br>
                </p>

                <p>Fallout: New Vegas and its making is a tale of true wonder and woe. Obsidian was tasked with making a full-fledged game in the span of a year and a half; unheard of for a AAA-level game, but absolutely killed it despite the time frame. Like all other Fallout entries, you're placed in a post-apocalyptic America in a menial character's body tasked with the superhuman task of essentially saving the world from itself. The story is usually a thinly-veiled criticism of America itself and how capitalism collapses in on itself given enough time, using satirical characters in the roles of the heroes and villains alike. You can choose between playing from a first-person and third-person view, using the help of your advanced V.A.T.S. (Vault Assisted Targeting System) wrist-bound computer to target an enemy's different body parts to afflict various status effects: head damage triggers an accuracy debuff, arms cause them to drop their weapon, and legs cause slowed movement. In New Vegas specifically, you're given an in-depth customization menu for improving and repairing your weapons and crafting different types of ammo and status effects for all of your guns. The game received an award for RPG of the Year, Best Strategy Game, and Best Story, and thus was given leeway for five DLCs which were given an equal (if not larger) amount of love from the developers. Truly a treat to play!</p>

                    Developers: BioWare <br><br>
                    Release date: July 2003 <br>
                </p>

                <p>Knights of the Old Republic was an amazing entry within Star Wars lore, as it took the roots of the Star Wars Universe and wrote its own unique points of interest apart from what the movies and novels go into. Taking place 4,000 years before the formation of the Galactic Empire, you play as a force-sensitive survivor of a crashing warship, getting the choice to play to the fancies of the light side or the dark side in what's called the Jedi Wars in the regular universe. While you do have much of your activity controlled by conversations, the gameplay features a round-based turn-by-turn combat mechanic in which you choose what skills to level up and whether to fight with melee, blasters, or purely Force-based attacks. It takes the time to go into untouched ground like the Gray Jedi, Force users who have no alignment to light or dark and only pursue experience with the Force, and the Sand People, a race forgotten by time but do not forget the mistakes of the father. Truly an amazing game that was also critically acclaimed on release, which touted famous voice actors such as Ed Asner, Ethan Phillips, and Jennifer Hale. It was also designed for reverse-compatibility, so there's no reason to skip this one or its continuation, Knights of the Old Repoublic II!</p>

                </p>

                <p>Darkest Dungeon is a very punishing game, having you create a four-man team of heroes to explore dungeons below a mansion the player has inherited. Mixing real-time movement with turn-based combat, your characters experience events that will either stress them out, mentally empower them, or even give them debuffs in the form of diseases to hamper progress on your run. A very simple and straightforward game, but like Dead Cells and Binding of Isaac, it has an immense capacity for replayability and hundreds of hours' worth of time spent trying to even beat the game or perfecting your strategy/build for your run. It is absolutely worth your time! </p>
