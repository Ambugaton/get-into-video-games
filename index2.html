            The action genre most always involves a challenge for the player to overcome with basic hand-to-eye coordination and motor skills. The scope has become rather wide over the years with a massive variety of sub-genres.

                BAYONETTA <br><br>
                Publishers: Sega, Nintendo <br><br>
                Developers: Platinum Games <br><br>
                Release date(s): October 2009 || October 2014 <br>
                </p>

                <p>Bayonetta takes a unique perspective in playing off the typical character-action genre, making a unique fighting game experience out of an fantasy-based premise. You play as a demon using hair-based magic to defeat your angelic foes, trying to conquer your amnesia and simultaneously toeing the line between the usual dichotomy of good and evil counterparts within these two warring factions. Playing to the fancies of the fans of Devil May Cry, there's an incredibly deep move list to earn and customize throughout the telling of the story; much like Devil May Cry you can unlock a multitude of moves, and this game in particular features a hyper-specific combo mechanic that allows you to dodge out of your own chosen attack while still maintaining the order of the strike you left off on during your original combo (or "dodge offset" for short). You get the beloved Platinum Games touch to the game, as it implements several different types of gameplay modes outside the regular action genre: between the usual fighting game platform, you get turret sequences, hidden arena-type fights with intense difficulty spikes, and even Bullet Hell-type sequences that change perspective from a third-person adjustable camera to an over-the-shoulder angle where you're fighting enemies straight ahead, akin to your Star Fox or Ikaruga types. This game unfortunately didn't sell particularly well, but was well-received by Platinum Games fans and fighting game fans alike and recently gained attention from superstar Lady Gaga via recent Twitter posts. Both installations are a great time!</p>

                Developers: Motion Twin, Evil Empire <br><br>

                <p>Dead Cells takes up a true gumbo of a mantle of sub-genres: rogue-like metroidvania, which is a term typically describing a procedurally-generated dungeon crawler based on the structure of RPGs Metroid and Castlevania series. You play as a newly-reanimated corpse, and must fight your way out of the dungeon you've been locked in. Your controls are as standard as it gets: control stick for movement, jump, dodge roll, and an attack button for each of the three items you can equip. This game features an effect of permanent death or "perma-death" for short, which means you'll lose all progress when you die to any enemy or boss. Each weapon or usable item is randomly generated and are limited at first, but the player can collect "cells" as a means of permanently unlocking items for your next run through. The game is plenty hard for beginners and metroidvania vets alike, so you'll be doing plenty of runs to unlock the multitude of invented or homaged items the devs have put in the game between the original alpha to the current finished version and DLCs. The developers stated they were inspired by the Binding of Isaac, both of which have an immense amount of love and character poured into them.</p>

                DEVIL MAY CRY<br><br>
                Publishers: Capcom <br><br>
                Developers: Capcom, with most projects headed by Hideaki Itsuno, Hideki Kamiya, Shinji Mikami, and Bingo Morihashi <br><br>
                Release date(s): August 2001 || January 2003 || February 2005 || January 2008 || January 2013 || February 2020 <br>

                    The Devil May Cry series has gotten its reputation through repeated entries and an eventual perfection of the combo-based action genre; with a heavy basis in the aesthetics of the character-action subgenre, you control one of many characters and unlock an arsenal of different attacks to juggle enemies, dodge attacks, close distances, or even nullify damage with a well-timed parry or cross-counter. It can seem like a simple arcade beat-em-up or hack'n'slash on the surface, but by stringing multiple and varied attacks using a specific rhythm or great enough efficiency, you build up what's called a Style Meter that judges your performance from the lowest D rank to the highest peak of a SSS rank. The story is loosely based on the Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri; the story will be rather serious and its characters are a refreshingly goofy foil, but the game as a whole remains utterly stylish, and each part of the combat system helps bring out the wackiness of the situations you find yourself in. Lots of the motion capture work was done by stunt actors in the Power Rangers series, and most all of the fighting shown in cutscenes shines a brilliant light on how absolutely bombastic the action becomes as a result.

                Publishers: id Software <br><br>
                Developers: Bethesda Softworks <br><br>
                Release date: December 1993 || October 1994 || June 1996 || March 1997 || August 2004 || April 2005 || May 2016 || March 2020 <br>

                <p>Doom is one of the First Person Shooter games that has come a long way from its original build. From the early days of its original release in 1993 to its most recent release of Doom Eternal this year, id Software has taken this game through the ringer to great effect. You start out as an unnamed protagonist, punished for punching your superior in the face and getting sent on a military mission to Mars. Through any and all iterations of every story, you're tasked with defeating the demons emerging from some portal or gate to Hell. It's always been as straightforward as shooters get, but its unique enemy design and gameplay has helped carve the way for the FPS genre and the original Doom is frequently cited as one of the greatest games of all time. It's proven as much with the sheer volume of Doom "clones" that try to emulate the effect of the original. The love persists vicariously through the community and fanbase both, as they've created a multitude of mods of the original Doom: anything from a Tim Allen-based reskin to a complete re-creation of the game into something new has become reality and commonplace.</p>

                <p>God Hand is one of the few games that decides to flip the fighting game world on its head with a completely new take. It will forever stand as one of my all-time favorites; it chooses an over-the-shoulder camera angle (mimicking Resident Evil 4) on top of a completely customizable move set and a difficulty system that makes it harder as you dodge hits or easier when you take damage. You have complete freedom to choose between punches or kicks, varied styles like drunken fist, what moves come out of your tilt-based attacks, and any special moves you like to create your own fluid system and means of attack. You take the role of Gene, fighting the good fight: saving the girl, defeating the demons who stole your arm, and fighting your way to the top of the tower of power made up of bug-based supervillains and parody-based mid bosses like Jim Kelly (Bruce Lee's counterpart in Enter the Dragon) or just a dude in a gorilla suit with an impeccable german suplex. An absolute atrocity to anyone who's looking for a 10/10 narrative, but an absolute joy to anyone that wants a skill-based thrill ride through a completely unique single-player fighting game that doesn't bother taking itself seriously in the slightest.</p>

                Release date: October 2010 <br>
                </p>

                <p>Vanquish is one of those games that got a lot of work put into the combat system, but didn't attract very much attention due to its difficulty spikes and a detachment from any long-standing series or properties. You have an immense amount of leeway in terms style while shooting your way through the story; from speed boosting and power-sliding through the legs of your enemies to shoot hidden weak spots, to performing wild melee-based counter attacks on incoming foes, or even spitting out your cigar and shooting it in midair to draw an enemy's attention and string it all into one long combo for more points on the board. You can tell from watching each cutscene that someone had an absolute ball designing the setplay: every thing is so dramatically over the top for even the most mundane sequences that you just want to lean forward and see just how far it all goes. Despite all the fanfare about style and grace, it truly is a difficult game: you choose which guns you want in your loadout per each checkpoint, how much ammo you dispense per each enemy, which guns you prefer to upgrade, and how many of your AI-controlled teammates you can save by clearing missions in a short enough amount of time. The game moves fast, and while console versions of the game lock the framerate between 30-60 frames per second, the PC version allows for unlimited frames, boasting an incredible speed needed to play the game well. Truly a bizarre turn of design choice, but all-the-more welcome for Platinum fans looking for their usual challenge.</p>

                Developers: Superhot Team <br><br>
                Release date: February 2016 <br>
                </p>

                <p>The Superhot Team took a lot of time to bring their game to fruition between its announcement "date" during the 2013 7 Day FPS Challenge and its eventual release, but it truly paid off in an amazing minimalist-style First-Person Shooter entry. The core idea behind Superhot is that "time moves when you move," giving you time to think your plans through but also punishing the player when taking actions. All in all, it makes your all of your gameplay look so good that you might as well be filming a promotional trailer for the game itself. Enemies appear in red, weapons are all in black, and every level is cast against a bright white or gray environment that makes everything pop to great effect. The gameplay itself worked so smoothly that it was seamlessly ported to virtual reality (VR) versions of the game, and turns it into one of the most satisfying entries on VR to date. Anything about the story would spoil it, so get out there and go play it!</p>
