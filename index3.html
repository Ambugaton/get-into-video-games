            An action-adventure game mixes the typical focus on the player's assigned character with alternate focal points like exploration, puzzle-solving, or combat. This "gumbo" style of genre benefits the play experience in a number of ways, depending on how refined each of these categories can become.

                <p id="body-text">The Legend of Zelda series has been around for a long time, spanning from the original on the Famicom in 1986 to the most recent Breath of the Wild on Nintendo Switch in 2017. This is one of the earliest examples of an open-world, non-linear game, and combines the action genre with exploration elements, multiple puzzle styles, a monetary system, and a simplified RPG-style to build up the role of the player-controlled Hero character. The series would go on to influence the styles of some of the biggest hits in the same vein, like the Final Fantasy and Metroid series both.</p>

                <p id="body-text">Batman: Arkham Asylum is one of those exceptional games that comes around every once in a while to re-define a genre, but also just re-define the way the story is told. You're in control of the hero Batman, who must secure Arkham Asylum from the hands of The Joker while you've simultaneously been locked into the asylum with the standard and supernatural inmates of Arkham. The team takes the time to either recreate or deconstruct popular characters like Killer Croc, Harley Quinn, The Riddler, or even Calendar Man through various run-ins or encounters with lab files, write-ups, or audio logs on each character. You're mainly led into solving the mystery as the classic "detective" persona of Batman/Bruce Wayne, but you're given a unique and very fluid combat system with a locked-in combo string, counter-striking, variable dodges, and interwoven use of gadgets to interact with enemies or the environment around you. Although you're not able to customize yourself as much as you'd like in terms of what punches and kicks you put out, your choice of how to enter the fray and your use of gadgets give you a truly free reign over your playstyle. Heralded as one of the most critically acclaimed superhero games ever, it simply must be played!</p>

                <p id="body-text">The God of War series has taken an interesting set of turns throughout the years, and while I've had my own doubts about its future, its newest installment seems to take a liking to flexing its Oscar chops and making a movie-like experience on top of its many new facets. With its origins deep in an action-style sequence little more than hack'n'slash, God of War 4 adds exploration, puzzles to solve with acquired items or abilities, and even a low-key promise of finally delving into the mythos of prehistoric civilizations outside its origins in Greece.</p>

                    Publishers: 2K Games <br><br>
                    Developers: 2K Boston, 2K Australia <br><br>
                    Release date: August 2007 <br>
                </p>

                <p id="body-text">Bioshock started as just a first-person shooter, but evolved into an incredible narrative that we all know and love today. Set in 1960, you play protagonist Jack after his airplane crashes in the ocean near the entry point of the underwater city called Rapture. You explore the city to find a utopia turned dystopia, as Rapture's people discovered the existence of ADAM, which are genetic materials they could use to gain superhuman powers. Overuse turned these people into what slang has deemed Splicers, now-murderous citizens looking to gain whatever's left of their precious substance. The storyline gives the player a morality-based path, letting you choose who you'd prefer to aid and how good of a person you'd like to be to those who'll let you get a word in edgewise. In more gameplay-oriented terms, you're also given the choice of how to explore the area: via stealth, hacking into security systems, chooing how to upgrade weapons with your limited supplies, and what powers you'd like to obtain to guide you through the turmoil.</p>

                    RED DEAD REDEMPTION <br><br>

                    Developers: Rockstar San Diego <br><br>
                    Release date: May 2010 <br>
                </p>

                <p id="body-text">Red Dead Redemption comes from the team that brought us Grand Theft Auto, but comes from a much different character's perspective and a much different era of our history. You play as John Marston, a former outlaw playing a hired gun for the government in order to save his captive wife and son. The game is played from a third-person open world perspective during the declining American Frontier in 1911. The more general goals of the story aim you at bringing three members of your former gang to "justice." Red Dead Redemption is one of the most expensive video games ever made; with visuals that still stand up well today on the previous generation's systems, dynamically-generated music, voice acting, gameplay, and even an outstanding downloadable content addition called Undead Nightmare (later released as a standalone game) that has a zombified John Marston finding the cure for an infectious zombie plague. Truly a game that stands the test of time, its sequel Red Dead Redemption II also saw similarly critial acclaim as one of the greatest games ever made. You won't be disappointed!</p>

                    THE LAST OF US <br><br>
                    Publishers: Sony Computer Entertainment <br><br>
                    Developers: Naughty Dog <br><br>
                    Release date: June 2013 <br>
                </p>

                <p id="body-text">The Last of Us puts you in control of Joel, a smuggler in what's essentially a post-apocalyptic world that's tasked with escorting teenaged Ellie across what remains of the United States. It's a third-person shooter that equips the player with improvised weapons and firearms, although it takes the survival-horror route of supplying the player with the minimal amount of ammunition and supplies to get by. You're pitted against hostile humans but later come into contact with cannibalistic creatures and monsters that have come into contact with a mutated strain of the Cordyceps fungus, a parasitic fungus that would usually appear on insects and arthropods in our world today. The audience waited for its release with bated breath, as the release was set on the end of the PS3's life cycle. Despite the timeline, the game was critically acclaimed and set the bar on every aspect from narrative, to voice acting, to gameplay, and the depiction of its female characters. It did so well, it would even see a remastered version when the PS4 eventually dropped in November of 2013.</p>

                    OKAMI <br><br>
                    Publishers: Capcom <br><br>
                    Developers: Clover Studio <br><br>
                    Release date: April 2006 <br>
                </p>

                <p id="body-text">Okami is a beautiful game, mixed with the typical goofiness of a PlatinumGames touch but awash with beautiful calligraphy-inspired designs within each character, the environments, and the gameplay itself. It uses Japanese mythology and folklore to tell the story of how the main character Amaterasu, the Shinto Goddess of the Sun, takes the form of a white wolf and saves a classical-era Japan from darkness. You're equipped with rather atypical tools like the Celestial Brush, which uses a gesture-based system to attack enemies and interact with the world itself. Clover Studio switched to a cel-shaded style for the game to reduce the processing, which eveentually led to the Celestial Brush concept. The gameplay is modeled on The Legend of Zelda, one of director Hideki Kamiya's favorite series. The original PS2 copy is a lot tougher to get a hold of, but I implore you to try the remaster edition on the Nintendo Switch! It's a long game, but the narrative is worth the trek. </p>

                <p id="body-text">Dark Souls has been a tribute to how difficult a standard game can become, but through every trial and tribulation becomes one of the most rewarding games out there today. Nothing much is defined by means of narrative, giving the story's moral choices more of an option for a self-insert path and an ambiguous choice between what should be good or evil in your story. Your core goal is certainly to defeat enemies and reach the final encounter, but one of the core mechanics is exploration and the facilitation thereof. You play as the Chosen Undead, a speechless protagonist amongst an audience that is in the same state as you: Undead, but are on the brink or past the point of no return. Everyone, including your Chosen Undead has a goal, and it becomes consistently unclear whether or not you're doing good by helping them on their way. You level up with "souls" you receive from each enemy, filing them into an array of statistics that determine what type of weapons or amor you can equip, moreover determining what kind of fighting/playing style you'll adopt. Each playthrough makes me fall more in love with the game, and moreso the continuation of the series and its spinoffs, Bloodborne and Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. All have their own strengths and weaknesses, but the first entry is truly something to behold! </p>
